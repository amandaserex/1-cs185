                Hi! My name is Amanda Serex and I am a third year Computer Science student at UCSB.
                I love taking on problems and finding unique and efficent ways to solve them. I 
                have been playing sports my whole life so I am a strong team player and spend 
                a lot of time outside. I love to spend time at the beach with friends, going water 
                skiing and hiking. I am currently working hard to expand my project portfolio as well.
