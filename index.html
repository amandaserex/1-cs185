                To the left is a picture of Lake Combie in Meadow Vista, California.
                This was taken at sunset on kayaks despite the very cold weather and
                water temperature. As long as you don't fall in that is not much of an 
                issue though. There is a reported mountain lion in the area though so 
                it is important to be aware of that. There are also lots of deer and other 
                wildlife.
